# OECD Well-being Data Monitor

This repository contains the code and documentation to build and run the [**OECD Well-being Data Monitor**](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/tools/well-being-data-monitor.html), an interactive dashboard for exploring:

- **Current and future well-being** across countries and indicators  
- **Gaps between groups**, such as sex, age, education, and other population breakdowns  

The project is implemented in R (Shiny) and draws upon the OECD Well-being database.
